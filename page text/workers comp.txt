Accidents happen in the most unlikely of places, even at your place of employment. Do not sit back and let your employer or the insurance carrier bully you into thinking it was your fault or that your accident was not covered under the Workers Compensation Act. All places of employment are supposed to be safe and accident free zones but when accidents occur at work or on the jobsite all employees in South Carolina are entitle to receive Workers’ Compensation Benefits.
