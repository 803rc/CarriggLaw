K-2, BATH SALTS & SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA ATTORNEY
In the last several years many convenience stores and other retail stores have been selling “Legal Marijuana” or “synthetic marijuana”. This is an extremely dangerous drug that often has horrific consequences.  John Carrigg has handled several cases against the sellers of these drugs to recover for injuries caused by the drugs themselves or caused by people who are intoxicated from taking the drug and cause injury.  State and Federal Lawmakers have attempted to outlaw these drugs but the manufacturers just keep changing the formula to attempt to stay ahead of the law.  However John Carrigg has successfully been able to bring these cases to court and make the sellers of these dangerous drugs pay for the damage they cause.

It is sad that store owners and business operators would prey on our young people with this highly dangerous drug all for the sake of making a dollar.
